## Functionality
The PaymentApplicationEgyFwd project offers the following features:

- Card Module: This module is responsible for handling card-related operations, such as reading card information and validating transactions.
- Terminal Module: The terminal module manages the interaction between the card and the application. It processes user inputs and sends commands to the card.
- Server Module: This module acts as the backend of the application, handling transaction requests, processing payments, and managing transaction logs.
- App Module: The main application module brings together the card, terminal, and server modules to perform complete transaction procedures. It serves as the user interface and orchestrates the entire payment process.
